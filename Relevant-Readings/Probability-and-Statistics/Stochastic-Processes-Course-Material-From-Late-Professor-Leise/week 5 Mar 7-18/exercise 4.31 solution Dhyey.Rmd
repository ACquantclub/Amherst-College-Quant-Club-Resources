## R Markdown for the problem by Dhyey Mavani

```{r}
# defining the branch function
branch <- function(n) {
  z <- c(1,rep(0,n))
  for (i in 2:(n+1)) {
    z[i] <- sum(sample(0:4, z[i-1], replace=T))
  }
  return (z)
}
```

```{r}
# simulation 1 is about 3rd generation extinction
# simulation 2 is about the long term extinction

num_trials <- 70000

sim1 <- numeric(num_trials) 
sim2 <- numeric(num_trials)

for (i in 1:num_trials) {
  out <- branch(10)
  sim1[i] <- if (out[4]==0) 1 else 0 
  sim2[i] <- if (out[11] == 0) 1 else 0
}

mean(sim1) # this mean is P(Z_3 = 0)

mean(sim2) # this mean signifies extinction probability e

pgf <- function(s) (1/5)*(1+s+s^2+s^3+s^4)

# this represents G_3(0) which should be indeed similar to P(Z_3 = 0)
pgf(pgf(pgf(0)))
